// variable scope is the context in which a variable is declared.

// In JavaScript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.

// JavaScript has two scopes â€“ global and local.

// A variable declared outside a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code.

// Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions.
